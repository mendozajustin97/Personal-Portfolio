                <h1>About me</h1>
                <h3><strong>Hello everyone, my name is Justin.</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    I am 25 years old former certified nurses assistant of 2 years. I have spent about 5 years in the medical field aspiring to become a Nurse Practitioner. However, I have recently grew tired and overworked and I had been searching for new horizons. My friends are in the tech industry and they had persuaded me on taking a leap of faith. I had moved out of my parents house right before the pandemic and immediatly stability had been my numberone target. The things that kept me going were my loving fiance, my passion for soccer, hiking and our little pooch.

                <!-- Career change -->
                <h1>What made you want to be a Programmer?</h1>
                <p> I needed to work in a field where I can showcase my creativity and elevate my family's life to another level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started teaching myself how to code watching Youtube tutorials and taking Udemy courses. I was struggling a lot trying and whoever is a 
                    self-taught programmer knows is not easy. I learned Html, Css and a bit of JavaScript but I was still not able to have a strong grasp in the 
                    subject and I sometimes felt like an imposter, just following tutorials in order to build a project.

                <h1>Why Coding Temple?</h1>
                <h3><strong> I needed help</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    If you're like me (self-taught) you probably have gone through the same issue, failed to learn on your own. All you hear on the internet
                    is that bootcamps are expensive, you shouldn't go to one, you can learn all that on your own. In reality all that is true but I needed 
                    help in order to get where I wanted. I feel confident with Html and Css but I have no experience at all with another language. Coding Temple
                    has giving me confidence I never thought I had in order to do things like understanding data structure and algorithms. I decided to join this 
                    program mostly because I want a change in my career and I know that with my passion and love for coding I will get there.
